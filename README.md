# Implementing Machine Learning Algorithms to Classify Postures and Forecast Motions When Using a Dynamic Chair



Many modern jobs require long periods of sitting on a chair that may result in serious
health complications. Dynamic chairs are proposed as alternatives to the traditional sitting chairs;
however, previous studies have suggested that most users are not aware of their postures and do
not take advantage of the increased range of motion offered by the dynamic chairs. Building a
system that identifies users’ postures in real time, as well as forecasts the next few postures, can
bring awareness to the sitting behavior of each user. In this study, machine learning algorithms have
been implemented to automatically classify users’ postures and forecast their next motions. The
random forest, gradient decision tree, and support vector machine algorithms were used to classify
postures. The evaluation of the trained classifiers indicated that they could successfully identify users’
postures with an accuracy above 90%. The algorithm can provide users with an accurate report of
their sitting habits. A 1D-convolutional-LSTM network has also been implemented to forecast users’
future postures based on their previous motions, the model can forecast a user’s motions with high
accuracy (97%). The ability of the algorithm to forecast future postures could be used to suggest
alternative postures as needed.
